              of record-keeping information that websites often store on a

              e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally
              identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's
              computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit (such as
              the products placed in your shopping cart). You can always disable
              cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being

              used by computers on the network to identify your computer every
              time you log on to the Internet.
